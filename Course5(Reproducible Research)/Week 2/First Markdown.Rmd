This is First R Markdown file.  

Here we are going to load some data.  

```{r}  
library(datasets)  
data(airquality)  
summary(airquality)  
```  

Lets make a pairs plot of data.  

```{r}  
pairs(airquality)  
```   

Here's regression model of ozone on wind, temperature and solar radiation.  

```{r}  
library(stats)  
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)  
summary(fit)  
```  


Here's an unordered list:
